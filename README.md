# Automated Deployment of Flask-Based Student Registration App Using Jenkins on AWS EC2

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop and deploy a simple Flask-based **Student Registration Web Application** on an AWS EC2 live server using a **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline**. The application allows users to submit student details through a web form, which are then stored in a **MySQL database** hosted on **Amazon RDS**.

This project demonstrates:

- Web development using Flask (Python)
- Backend integration with MySQL
- DevOps practices using Jenkins for Continuous Deployment
- Full automation of deployment via Jenkins to a production EC2 server

---

## 📚 Introduction

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end automation** and deployment of a Flask-based Student Registration Web Application using Jenkins. The CI/CD pipeline pulls the latest code from GitHub and deploys it to a live EC2 instance via SSH.

Key integrations include:

- **Cloud infrastructure** (AWS EC2, RDS)
- **DevOps tools** (Jenkins, Git)
- **Web application stack** (Python, Flask, MySQL)

🚀 Implementation Steps

🔹 Step 1: Launch EC2 Instances
Instance 1: Jenkins Server
Instance 2: Live Web Server

🔹 Step 2: Setup Jenkins Server
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
docker run -d --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts

🔹 Step 3: Setup Jenkins Job
Create a Pipeline Job
Configure GitHub repo and Jenkinsfile
Use SSH Credentials to connect to the live EC2 server

🔹 Step 4: Setup Live EC2 Web Server
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install git python3 -y
pip3 install flask mysql-connector-python
git clone https://github.com/Akshata-Waikar/Python_through_jenkins.git
cd Python_through_jenkins

Update db_config in app.py with your RDS endpoint and credentials.

🔹 Step 5: Setup RDS MySQL Database
Create an Amazon RDS (MySQL) instance
Database Name: studentsdb
Table: students (as shown above)

🔹 Step 6: Jenkinsfile Pipeline
The Jenkinsfile handles:
SSH to the live server
Cloning the latest code
Killing any existing Flask process
Restarting the application

🔹 Step 7: Trigger Jenkins Build
Automatically deploys updated Flask app to the live server

🔹 Step 8: Test Application
Visit: http://<Live_EC2_Public_IP>:5000
Submit form and check if data is stored in RDS.

✅ Conclusion
This project successfully implements a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate deployment of a Flask web application on AWS EC2, backed by an RDS MySQL database.
It demonstrates core DevOps practices:
- Git-based version control
- Jenkins-based automation
- Secure remote deployments via SSH
- Web application deployment in a production-like environment
